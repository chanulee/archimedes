# Spere
The Sphere is a pokeball-like haptic artefact that allows a user to capture local AIs when in use and ‘feel’ the AI as it works, to facilitate a more understandable push and pull / conversation.  
  
Problem:  
* Misconception of ‘all-knowing AI' leads to imprecise prompting and false expectations — disconnect between understanding the limitations of AI as it works.
* Fine-tuning, refining and backtracking parameters is difficult, linear and slow.
  
Solution:  
* Haptic feedback to show AI thought process (output)
* Tactile controls to freeze and re-influence prompt parameters while in flow (input)
